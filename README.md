# 🧠 CTF Labs for Ethical Hacking Practice

Welcome to your hacking playground! This repo is packed with beginner-friendly CTF machines designed to help you learn ethical hacking in a safe and structured way.

## 🚀 Why This Exists

Starting out in cybersecurity can feel overwhelming. These machines are here to learn and improve:

- Common vulnerabilities and exploits
- Enumeration and privilege escalation
- Realistic attack scenarios (without the legal risk!)
- Develop methodologies for vulnerability analysis and exploitation

## 🧰 What You’ll Find

- Virtual machines you can run locally (VirtualBox/VMware)
- Optional walkthroughs to help when you get stuck
- Tips, tools, and cheat sheets for new hackers

## 🛡️ Important Reminder

This is for learning only. Never use these techniques outside of a controlled lab or without permission. Ethical hacking means hacking **with consent**.

## 💡 Before You Start

- Install a virtualization tool (VirtualBox or VMware)
- Use a Linux distro like Kali or Parrot OS
- Brush up on basic networking and Linux commands
